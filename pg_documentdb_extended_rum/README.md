# DocumentDB RUM - RUM access method

## Introduction

The documentdb_extended_rum access method derives its storage from the RUM index access method which originally derives from Postgres's GIN access method.
GIN and RUM were optimized for full text search type scenarios and were then extended to handle JSONB based schema-free inverted index queries as well. 
As this was extended towards the documentdb's BSON types, modifications were made to support more schema free scenarios.

Note that the folloiwng invariants are true:
1) From a storage standpoint, its content on disk is backwards compatible with that of RUM (it is fully back-wards compatible)
2) All changes must be made only on the query path and operator class extensibility path or in a way that works for indexes that are built with the default RUM repo.
3) Storage changes were made such that RUM itself could continue functioning on the same stored index

## Details

The documentdb_rum index layout consists of 3 types of PostgreSQL pages:
1) The META page - Stored at Block 0 and contains metadata about the index
2) ENTRY Pages - These store the core index entries that are used for lookups and are laid out as a BTree. The root page for this tree is stored at Block 1.
3) DATA Pages - These are posting trees storing bitmaps of rows matching a given entry The root of each posting tree is committed in the Entry that roots the tree.
